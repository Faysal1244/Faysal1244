### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Faysal Rahman
#### I'm Faysal from Bangladesh and I am a full stack web developer. I really enjoy learning languages and frameworks like Php and Laravel , as well as work in WordPress. I also enjoy wireframing, ui, ux, and design in general.
I made this project just for fun, it allows you to create nice and simple GitHub Readme files that you can copy/paste and use in your profile.

Skills: Laravel / PHP/Java / JS / HTML / CSS

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Laravel 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java
